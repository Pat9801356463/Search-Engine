Statistical Laws Governing The Occurence Of Word

(ii) Heaps Law : rate at which new words will appear 
(iii) Dependence : clumpy / contagious nature of words
Mandelbort Law extension of zipf's law  (i.e. Pr = c / (r+q)^b;
Heaps Law  v = no of new words seen ; n = no of words => v = k * n^b; b ~ 0.5;
clumping says if you found a rare word in text then the probability of finding it again increases enormously 
index size = na * nb /nab ; assuming occurence of a & b are independent
